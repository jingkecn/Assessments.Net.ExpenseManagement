Domain Modeling (Tactical DDD)
==============================

The domain model is an abstract model of the business domain, which:

- Distills and organizes domain knowledge
- Provides a common language for developers and domain experts

We'll break down each domain into:

- Aggregate root
- Entities
- Value objects
- Domain behaviors
- Domain events (not shown in UML but can be noted)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph ApplicationService["Application Service"]
    end

    subgraph DomainService["Domain Service"]
    end

    subgraph Aggregate1["Aggregate"]
        RootEntity["Root Entity"]
        Entity["Entity"]
        ValueObject["Value Object"]
    end

    subgraph Aggregate2["Aggregate"]
        ...
    end

    DomainEvent["Domain Event"]

    ApplicationService --> DomainService

    DomainService --> Aggregate1
    DomainService --> Aggregate2

    Aggregate1 --> DomainEvent
    Aggregate2 --> DomainEvent

    RootEntity --- Entity
    RootEntity --- ValueObject
```

For the rest of this design, we will focus on the [**Expense Management**](4.Expense%20Management.md) bounded context.
