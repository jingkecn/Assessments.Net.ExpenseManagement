Expense Management
------------------

> [!NOTE]
>
> Expense records are not strictly tied to the existence of an employee record.
>
> Due to compliance and auditing requirements, historical expense records must be retained and accessible even after an employee has been deleted from the system.
>
> As a result, these expense records remain available to administrators, ensuring that all financial data can be reviewed and managed independently of employee lifecycle events.

```http
GET /api/expenses?pageNumber={pageNumber}&pageSize={pageSize}
```

```http
GET /api/expenses/{id}
```

```http
DELETE /api/expenses/{id}
```
