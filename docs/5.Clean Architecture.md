| [Separation of Concerns](https://deviq.com/principles/separation-of-concerns)                   | "[Separation of Concerns], even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of." -- Edsger W. Dijkstra     |
| [Single Responsibility Principle](https://deviq.com/principles/single-responsibility-principle) | To define each responsibility of a class as a reason for change                                                                                                                     |
| [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://deviq.com/principles/dependency-inversion-principle)   | High level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.  Details should depend upon abstractions. |
| [Explicit Dependencies Principle](https://deviq.com/principles/explicit-dependencies-principle) | Methods and classes should explicitly require (typically through method parameters or constructor parameters) any collaborating objects they need in order to function correctly.   |
