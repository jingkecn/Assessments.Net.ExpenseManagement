| [CQRS](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/cqrs-pattern)                   | To optimize each of reads and writes for its specific use case.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Domain Events](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/domain-events-pattern) | To signify a state change in the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Mediator](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/mediator-pattern)           | To reduce dependencies, promote loose coupling, and make the system more modular and flexible.                                                                                                                                           |
| [Repository](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repository-pattern)       | To achieve loose coupling and keep domain objects [persistence ignorant](https://deviq.com/principles/persistence-ignorance).                                                                                                            |
| [Specification](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/specification-pattern) | To eliminates the need for lazy loading in web applications ([bad idea](https://ardalis.com/avoid-lazy-loading-entities-in-asp-net-applications/)) and helps keep repository implementations from becoming cluttered with these details. |
